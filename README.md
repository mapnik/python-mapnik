Python bindings for Mapnik.

## Installation

Eventually we hope that many people will simply be able to `pip install mapnik` in order to get prebuilt binaries,
this currently does not work though. So for now here are the instructions

### Create a virtual environment

It is highly suggested that you have [a python virtualenv](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) when developing
on mapnik.

### Building from Mason

If you do not have mapnik built from source and simply wish to develop from the latest version in [mapnik master branch](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik) you can setup your environment with a mason build. In order to trigger a mason build prior to building you must set the `MASON_BUILD` environment variable.

```bash
export MASON_BUILD=true
```

After this is done simply follow the directions as per a source build.

### Building from Source

Assuming that you built your own mapnik from source, and you have run `make install`. Set any compiler or linking environment variables as necessary so that your installation of mapnik is found. Next simply run one of the two methods:

```
python setup.py develop
```

If you are currently developing on mapnik-python and wish to change the code in place and immediately have python changes reflected in your environment.


```
python setup.py install
```

If you wish to just install the package.

```
python setup.py develop --uninstall
```

Will de-activate the development install by removing the `python-mapnik` entry from `site-packages/easy-install.pth`.


If you need Pycairo, make sure that PYCAIRO is set to true in your environment or run:

```
PYCAIRO=true python setup.py develop
```

### Building against Mapnik 3.0.x

The `master` branch is no longer compatible with `3.0.x` series of Mapnik. To build against Mapnik 3.0.x, use [`v3.0.x`](https://github.com/mapnik/python-mapnik/tree/v3.0.x) branch.

## Testing

Once you have installed you can test the package by running:

```
git submodule update --init
python setup.py test
```

The test data in `./test/data` and `./test/data-visual` are standalone modules. If you need to update them see https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/blob/master/docs/contributing.md#testing


### Troubleshooting

If you hit an error like:

```
Fatal Python error: PyThreadState_Get: no current thread
Abort trap: 6
```

That means you likely have built python-mapnik linked against a different python version than what you are running. To solve this try running:

```
/usr/bin/python <your script.py>
```

If you hit an error like the following when building with mason:

```
EnvironmentError: 
Missing boost_python boost library, try to add its name with BOOST_PYTHON_LIB environment var.
```

Try to set `export BOOST_PYTHON_LIB=boost_python` before build.
Also, if `boost_thread` or `boost_system` is missing, do likewise:

```
export BOOST_SYSTEM_LIB=boost_system
export BOOST_THREAD_LIB=boost_thread
```

If you still hit a problem create an issue and we'll try to help.
